                Hello, my name is Collin Umeh and I am a Computer Science student at Morgan State University. 
                I am currently a junior and I am apart of a Computer Science Club called "SACS" at Morgan State. 
                In my free time I love to reading books, building lego sets and watching sports. I like to occasionally voulenteer
                at a Housing Non-Profit and work as a Food Vendor at festivals.
            </h1>
            <h1 id="CollinDes">I am currently aspiring to get into the field of full-stack development as well as deep learning and ML. I also
                have a peak interest into UI/UX product design and cyber security.
